"""IMAP IDLE: notice new mail the moment it lands — **opt-in, and off here**.

Status of this module (read this before enabling it)
----------------------------------------------------
The mechanism works, and it was verified end to end rather than assumed:

* production is Python 3.14.4, where ``imaplib.IMAP4.idle()`` exists; the macOS
  dev box is 3.9, where it does not;
* both providers advertise ``IDLE`` in their pre-login ``CAPABILITY``;
* a plain IDLE connection to ``imap.qq.com`` receives ``EXISTS`` **~2 seconds**
  after a message is delivered (measured 2026-09-14).

**But it does not survive contact with our own poller.** Measured on
``imap.qq.com``, same mailbox, same script, only the surrounding traffic
differing:

===========================  ==================  ==================
IDLE window                  other connections   push received?
===========================  ==================  ==================
9 s, between poller ticks    poller active       **yes**, in 2 s
200 s, spanning 3 ticks      poller active       **no**
190 s, re-IDLE every 45 s    poller active       **no**
===========================  ==================  ==================

QQ appears to deliver unsolicited ``EXISTS`` only to the connection that most
recently selected the mailbox. Our 60-second poller re-selects on a fresh
connection every minute, so a long-lived IDLE connection is permanently deaf
after the first tick — and plain re-entry into IDLE (DONE, then IDLE again, which
is what this module does) does **not** win the channel back, because that is not
a ``SELECT``.

That leaves no good design here. Making IDLE the only connection to a mailbox
would mean giving up the poller, and with it the guarantee that mail is noticed
within one poll interval: a silent push failure would then cost
``INFE_PILOT_IDLE_SECONDS`` (300 s) instead of 60 s. Trading a proven bound for
an unproven one, to gain speed in the common case, is the wrong way round for a
product whose worst failure is "the user hears about a deadline too late".

So the switch defaults to **off**, and the code stays because it is tested,
harmless and cheap to re-evaluate. Enable it deliberately — ``INFE_PILOT_IDLE=1``
— and only after re-running the measurements above against the actual providers,
ideally with the concurrent poller stopped.

Why it is only a *trigger* when it is on
----------------------------------------
This module deliberately does **not** take over fetching. A notification wakes
it, and it then calls the ordinary ``PilotService.poll_mailbox`` — the same
cursor-based path the poller has always used, with its UIDVALIDITY handling,
same-mail de-duplication and sender filter. Reimplementing any of that here
would put the "never skip a mail" guarantee behind new, less-tested code.

Failure handling
----------------
A watcher that cannot connect backs off and retries; it never raises out of its
thread, because a dead watcher must not be able to take the worker down.
Connection errors are logged as warnings and anything else as an error with a
traceback, so a bug in this fail-soft module cannot hide as a flaky network.
