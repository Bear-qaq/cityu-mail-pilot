"""Validate an uploaded background image without an image library.

The runtime dependency budget allows only ``cryptography``, so there is no
Pillow here and there never will be. That turns out to be an advantage rather
than a limitation, but only if the rules are chosen deliberately.

Why each rule is what it is
---------------------------

**The declared Content-Type is never trusted.** blueimp's upload-security guide
(``jQuery-File-Upload/SECURITY.md``) says plainly that its sample handlers sniff
the *file extension*, which is why a renamed file gets through. The fix is to
read the bytes. Here the declared type has to *agree* with the sniffed one, and
an upload where they disagree is refused rather than corrected.

**SVG is refused outright, not sanitised.** SVG is a document format that can
carry ``<script>``. Delivering one from our own origin is stored XSS, and it is
a live advisory class rather than a hypothetical: ``GHSA-69hx-63pv-f8f4`` is a
stored-XSS-through-SVG-upload with a Content-Type validation bypass, and
``GHSA-xr97-25v7-hc2q`` is the same class in another project. A background photo
has no legitimate need for a vector document.

**Only JPEG and PNG.** WebP has three container variants and three different
places to read dimensions from; supporting it would triple the parsing surface
for a format no browser produces from ``canvas.toBlob`` without it also being
able to produce JPEG. blueimp's guide reaches the same place from the other
direction, restricting ImageMagick's coders to ``{GIF,JPEG,JPG,PNG}``.

**Dimensions are parsed, never decoded.** We never rasterise user input, so the
whole family of image-decoder vulnerabilities (ImageMagick's delegate and coder
escapes among them) is not reachable from here. The bound still matters for a
different reason: a 40000x40000 PNG is a few dozen bytes on the wire and a
multi-gigabyte allocation in the browser that has to draw it.

**Metadata is refused, not stripped.** Rewriting a JPEG or PNG container by hand
to remove EXIF is exactly the kind of parsing that turns a privacy feature into a
corruption bug. The browser already re-encodes from raw pixels through
``<canvas>``, which drops every ancillary chunk for free, so a normal upload
carries none. Anything that still does is a signal that the file did not come
through that path, and it is refused with a message that says which block was
found. Refusing is also strictly safer than rewriting: we never emit bytes we
have edited, so we cannot be the reason an image fails to render.
