"""Who visited, and from where — counted, not identified.

The question this answers is "有多少人浏览了我的网页", and the operator also
asked to see *where* visitors come from. Both halves are doable without turning
the site into a surveillance tool, but only if the two halves are stored
differently:

* **What is kept** is the countable part: which page, which day, which referring
  site, whether the visitor was a signed-in member, whether a robot fetched it,
  and the country/city resolved from the address at the moment of the visit.
* **What is not kept** is the address itself. The database gets
  ``SecretBox.anonymized(ip)`` — the same keyed digest the message board uses —
  so the same visitor can be recognised again for a unique-visitor count and
  nothing else. The raw address lives in a small in-memory ring buffer that is
  never written to disk, which is what lets the operator watch live traffic
  without the address ending up in the daily backup.

Why the digest and not a plain SHA-256: the whole IPv4 space is 2^32 and
enumerable in minutes, so a bare hash of an address *is* the address. The same
reasoning is written out in ``security.SecretBox.anonymized``; this module uses
that function rather than inventing a second definition of "anonymised".

Two more deliberate choices, both about honesty of the numbers:

* Robots are counted **separately**, never folded into the human total. This box
  sits on a public address, so scanners find it within hours; a "visitors" number
  that mixes ``odin-scanner/0.4`` with a real reader is not a number anybody can
  act on.
* ``DNT: 1`` and ``Sec-GPC: 1`` are honoured — those requests are not recorded at
  all, and the panel says how many were skipped for that reason, so the total
  never quietly claims to be everybody.
