"""AI operations assistant: explain a sentinel finding in plain language.

It is **not** an agent in the tool-using sense, and that is the design rather
than a missing feature. Three properties are the whole thing, and each one has a
test that fails if it stops being true:

1. **It cannot act.** The model's answer becomes text in an e-mail and a row in
   the database. It never picks a recipient, a URL, a search query or a command;
   there is no tool call, and nothing in the reply is parsed into anything
   executable. Private data + attacker-controlled text + an outbound channel is
   the standard exfiltration path, so the third ingredient is removed.
2. **It never sees private content.** No mail bodies, no subjects, no sender
   addresses, no user e-mail addresses. A user appears as their opaque id, and
   the mapping back happens here, after the model is finished. A subject line is
   written by whoever sent the mail: it is data, and the cheapest way to be safe
   with data is not to send it.
3. **It cannot spend without a ceiling.** The daily budget lives in SQLite and is
   checked *before* every call, and it fails closed. A model loop that keeps
   paying after the money is gone is the failure worth designing against.

Everything the model is shown is built by :func:`gather_context` from numbers and
enumerated states this program computed itself. Free text can still reach it --
an IMAP server's error string, say -- so those fields are fenced with an
explicit delimiter and the system prompt says the fenced part is data, never
instructions. That is OWASP LLM01's "separate and denote untrusted content",
and none of the comparable open-source projects does it.

See ``docs/agent-monitor-2026-09-15.md`` for the survey behind these choices.

      good, because nothing ever asked again.

    * findings whose newest analysis already matches their current shape --
      ``analyse`` would return ``reused`` without calling anything, but it would
